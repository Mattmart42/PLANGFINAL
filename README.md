# PLANGFINAL - Maze Agent
Project from AI used for PLang Final :)  

Check out my Maze Agent avoid pits and solve a maze!  

I do this by opening the project in VSCode and opening a new terminal.  

cd to src and run python enviroment.py to see the Agent in action.  

Edit the bottom of environemnt.py to change tick length, maze selection, and the maze itself.  

Hope you enjoy!
